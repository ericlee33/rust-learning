```rs
// The Debug trait is one of the most commonly used in Rust. It allows you to format the output in a programmer-facing, debugging context. The way you typically use it is like this:

let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
let s = format!("{:?}", v);
// Also, as of Rust 1.58 you can Debug-format a variable by putting it right after the opening curly bracket, like this:

let s = format!("{v:?}");
// If you want to Debug-format a custom type, such as a struct, you can simply use derive like this:

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Person {
    name: String,
    age: u8,
}
```

# panic

```rs
panic!("panic at here");
```

# ? 运算符

```rs
?
```
